# ExampleRepository
An example repository with the necessary files each project should have.
This includes:
* Code Files
* Schematics
* PCB Designs
* Photos of your device
* 3D Models of enclosures and other parts
* Data you collected with your device

## Features

* List some features here that your project includes
* This could be data outputs from it, math conversions that it does, etc

## Hardware

* List devices that your subsystem will use
* Microcontrollers, sensors, etc
* Every device will need a CAN-Bus and 5V voltage regulator, but this can happen towards the end of the design process
